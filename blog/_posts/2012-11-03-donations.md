I have had, since starting kbe, two or three people enquire about donations. It's a fantastic feeling; that someone without prompting would, of their own free accord, wish to encourage the project by donating money.

If you're wishing to donate–and I by no means want to encourage you to do so (staring the project [on GitHub][star] is all the reward I need)–then now you can with the new [PayPal donation page][paypal].

A link to this page can also be found at [kbengine.org](https://kbengine.github.io//) and, as a "Donate" button at the top of the GitHub project [readme page][readme].

I'm not sure if it's possible to discern this information, but if donators would agree, I will have a page immortalising those kind few who did give so graciously to kbe, by listing their names.

I'm so pleased that kbe has got to the stage where people think it's worth supporting!
